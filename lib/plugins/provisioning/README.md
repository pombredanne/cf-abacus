abacus-provisioning-plugin
===

Minimal example implementation of an Abacus provisioning plugin.

A provisioning plugin provides REST APIs used by the Abacus usage processing
pipeline to retrieve information about provisioned resources and the metering
plans which should be used to meter their usage.

This minimal Abacus provisioning plugin example is provided only for demo and
test purposes. An integrator of Abacus is expected to replace it with
a real production implementation.
